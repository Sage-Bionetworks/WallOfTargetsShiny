## Welcome to the AMP-AD Wall of Targets!

The Wall of Targets is an application to aggregate genomic evidence supporting candidate gene and module targets nominated by members of the AMP-AD consortium.

## Nominated Target List

The following is a list of all genes nominated by AMP-AD groups as targets of interest.

> Please click a gene from the list to view details and evidence. The table can be filtered to find a gene of interest by name by typing a gene symbol (e.g., 'VGF') in the search box on the right.
