### Pathways

Pathway information of biochemical reactions are used from the following databases:

#### Reactome

[Reactome](http://reactome.org/) is a free, open-source, curated and peer reviewed pathway database.

### RNA expression

#### EMBL-EBI Expression Atlas

Expression Atlas is an open science resource that gives users a powerful way to find information about gene and protein expression across species and biological conditions such as different tissues, cell types, developmental stages and diseases among others. Expression Atlas aims to help answering questions such as ‘where is a certain gene expressed?’ or ‘how does its expression change in a disease?’.

### Druggability

### Other external data

#### Oxford Drug Discovery Institute Druggability

ODDI Druggability data is available on Synapse at [syn7537835](https://www.synapse.org/#!Synapse:syn7537835).
 
#### Lilly/EBI DrugEBIlity
DrugEBIlity data is available on Synapse at [syn7525109](https://www.synapse.org/#!Synapse:syn7525109).

##### Scores

Score | Definition
------|-----------
0	| Unknown
1	| Has a closely related gene (“homolog”) with a known protein structure predicted or known to have one or more small-molecule ligand(s)
